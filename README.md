# About Me
My name is Nick Waweru. I have a legal and social science background. I have been a freelance Wordpress web developer for the last 3 years since 2017.

I found it very easy and interesting to practice web development via CMS like Wix.com and Wordpress, but at the same time i felt hindered and restricted in regards to becoming a full stack we developer as i could not understand the underlying of the web development industry as well as the platforms that i was already using.

i felt like i really wanted to study coding and programming at a higher level after i developed an interest in the global financial markets of stock and Forex trading. I found myself intrigued at Quant Trading, which forced me to pursue becoming a full stack web developer familiar with python, machine learning and data science so as to try and come up with an automated trading system that is profitable in the long run.

My hobbies include
* Web Development
* Trading and market research
* dog breeding and training
